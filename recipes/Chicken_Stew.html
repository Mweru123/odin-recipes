    <h3>Easy way to make Marry Me Chicken Stew</h3>

    <p>Succulent chicken breasts, sun-dried tomatoes, and a luscious cream sauce — our easy marry me chicken recipe is simply the best one-pan, 30-minute dinner out there!</p>
     
    <h3>Ingredients For Our Marry Me Chicken Recipe</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken breasts - We use boneless, skinless here, but boneless, skinless thighs also work. Feel free to pound the chicken breast a little thinner so they cook more quickly and evenly.</li>
        <li>Garlic - 3 cloves is what we call for, but as always 1-2 will be plenty, but there's always room for 4-6 if you love garlic.</li>
        <li>Heavy cream - We don't recommend subbing the heavy cream here. It's what creates the luscious, creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese - This will also help thicken and flavor the sauce. We always recommend freshly grated, because the pre-grated has anti clumping agents in it that will not melt in with your sauce as well.</li>
        <li>Sun-dried tomatoes - These are gonna get chopped up, so feel free to get the halves if you want, also we love the ones packed in oil.</li>
        <li>Italian seasoning - If you don't have this on hand, you can always swap with a little dried thyme.</li>
        <li>Chicken stock - Store bought or homemade, both work well.</li>
        <li>Chicken bouillon - We like “Better Than Bouillon” or you could use 1 chicken bouillon cube, crushed.</li>
        <li>Salt, pepper and olive oil</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes (optional) - This just adds a little heat, skip it if you want.</li>
        <li>Fresh basil - You could also top with some fresh minced parsley if that's all you have on hand, but we love the taste of fresh basil, nothing compares.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Brown the chicken breasts in a bit of oil in a large skillet (affiliate link) just until they’re a little crispy on the outside (they don’t need to be cooked through at this point). Set them aside.</li>
        <li>Make the creamy Marry Me Chicken sauce. Sauté a bit of garlic, stir in heavy cream, stock, bouillon, Parmesan, sun dried tomatoes, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken to the sauce. Tongs (affiliate link) are your friend! Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer, and cook until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F on an instant-read thermometer</li>
    
        <li>Serve Marry Me Chicken over comforting carbs, like Creamy Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes, or try with Classic Mashed Potatoes. People love to have Marry Me Chicken with pasta, too — try serving it over spaghetti or Linguine.
