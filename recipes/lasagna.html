    <h3>Best way to make Lasagna</h3>
    <p>Homemade lasagna may have a few steps, but each step is easy – and I assure you it’s worth the time; the perfect Italian meal! This is a really easy lasagna recipe.</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Cheese Filling: For this classic lasagna recipe, the filling contains ricotta and parmesan with seasonings and a couple of tablespoons of parsley. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!</li>
    <li>Meat: I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add a ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor.</li>
    <li>Sauce: To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer).
        Spinach (variation): To make a spinach lasagna, squeeze out most of the moisture of defrosted frozen spinach and add it along with the cheese layer.</li>

   </ul>

   <ol>
    <li>Boil pasta: Cook in a large pot of salted water</li>
    <li>Prepare meat sauce: Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
    <li>Combine cheese mixture: Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Layer & bake: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until browned and bubbly.</li>
   </ol>
